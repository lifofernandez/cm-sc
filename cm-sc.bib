To gain meaningful information or identifying the underlying patterns from social networks, summarization is an useful approach to enhance understanding of the pattern from big data. However, existing clustering and frequent item-set based summarization techniques lack the ability to produce meaningful summary and fails to represent the underlying data pattern. In this paper, the effectiveness co-clustering is explored to create meaningful summary of social network data such as Twitter. Experimental results show that, using co-clustering for creating summary provides significant benefit over the existing techniques.},

abstract = {This paper conducts a systematic literature review on knowledge management (KM) in the context of startups in order to analyze the state of the art, identify research gaps and define a future research agenda. The main findings highlight that, even though there is an increasing number of papers on the topic of KM in startups, several issues are still neglected. Specifically, the paper identifies four main gaps in the body of literature. The first gap deals with the environmental and socio-political factors influencing the adoption of KM in startups. The second gap regards the lack of a comprehensive taxonomy of knowledge management systems (KMSs) that may support the processes of knowledge creation, acquisition, storage, transfer, sharing and application. This second gap allows us to identify a third gap concerning the level of alignment between startup's strategies and technologies adopted. Finally, the fourth gap deals with the issue of the impact of KM on startup's performances with regard to economic, financial, market, technical, technological, organizational, human and relational performance. From these four gaps, six research questions (RQs) have been proposed. These RQs allow us to identify possible areas of analysis to define a future research agenda. Neglecting these issues means underestimating all the possible advantages of KM adoption for a startup to achieve efficiency, effectiveness and scalability goals.},

In this context, it is important to be able to identify and characterize users who contribute and communicate their knowledge in the network and help others to get their work done. In this paper, we propose a new methodological approach consisting of three steps, namely “message classification” “identification of users' roles” as well as “characterization of users' roles”. We apply the approach to a dataset from a multinational consulting company, which allows us to identify three user roles based on their knowledge contribution in messages: givers, takers, and matchers. Going beyond this categorization, our data shows that whereas the majority of messages aims to share knowledge, matchers, that means people that give and take, are a central element of the network. In conclusion, the development and application of a new methodological approach allows us to contribute to a more refined understanding of users' knowledge exchanging behavior in Enterprise Social Networks which can ultimately help companies to take measures to improve their knowledge management.},

abstract = {Purpose. The SECI model (Nonaka, 1994) is the most well-known conceptual framework for knowledge generation in organizations, a crucial drive for competitive advantage. To date, however, empirical support for this theorization has been overlooked. The present study aimed to provide an evidence-based groundwork for the SECI model by testing a multidimensional questionnaire (KMSP-Q), designed to capture the knowledge conversion modes theorized by Nonaka. Methodology. In a twofold study, the knowledge generation construct was operationalized with generating the KMSP-Q. Specifically, Study One tested its 8-dimensional structure through exploratory and confirmatory factorial analyses on 372 employees from different sectors. Study Two examined the construct validity and reliability by replicating the KMSP-Q factor structure in knowledge intensive contexts (on a sample of 466 health-workers), and by investigating the unique impact of each dimension on some organizational outcomes (i.e. performance, innovativeness, collective efficacy). Findings. The overall findings highlighted that the KMSP-Q is a psychometrically robust questionnaire in terms of both dimensionality and construct validity, the different knowledge generation dimensions being specifically linked to different organizational outcomes. Research/Practical implications. The KMSP-Q may contribute to actualize and provide empirical consistency to the theory underlying the SECI model. Moreover, it allows for the monitoring of the organization's capability to manage new knowledge and detecting the strengths/weaknesses of KM policies and related programs. Originality/value. This paper proposes a comprehensive measure of knowledge generation in work contexts, highlighting processes that organizations are likely to promote in order to improve their performance through the management of their knowledge resources.},

abstract = {Purpose: Enterprise social networks (ESN) are increasingly used by companies to reinforce collaboration and knowledge sharing. While prior research has investigated ESN use practices, little is known about potential user roles emerging on these platforms. Against this backdrop, this paper develops an ESN knowledge actor role framework. Design/methodology/approach: The framework is constructed based on a systematic review of literature covering knowledge worker role typologies, user roles identified in public online social spaces as well as findings from ESN research. Findings: The ESN knowledge actor role framework distinguishes eight contributing and two reading roles. It describes the associated participation behaviours and establishes metrics to identify the roles. Research limitations/implications: Providing a notion of knowledge management-related roles in ESN, the framework enables a better understanding of knowledge processes and the involved actors. Moreover, the paper advances the field of ESN data analytics by designing a set of ESN metrics to characterise user behaviour. Practical implications: Understanding ESN user roles, in particular regarding their knowledge contributions to the platform, can improve knowledge transparency in companies. The framework may usefully support the identification and management of critical knowledge resources and support decision-making in the areas of human resources management and knowledge management. Originality/value: Providing a platform for knowledge-intensive interactions as well as record of user activities, ESN are well suited to observe and identify knowledge actor roles emerging in this context.},

abstract = {The analysis of user behavior in online communities is a prominent topic in social media research. As such, user behavior is often analyzed using a set of metrics that describe the user's participation behavior and structural position in the social network. Yet, for Enterprise Social Networks (ESN), i.e. internally used social networking platforms, such research is lacking. While prior studies have found users to engage in knowledge-intensive interactions, e.g. discussing and developing new ideas, little is known about how to conceptualize and measure ESN user behavior. Being able to measure user behavior, however, is an important prerequisite for the identification of knowledge management-related roles in the context of ESN. Against this backdrop, in this chapter we derive 30 metrics that characterize the participation behavior, message content and structural position of ESN users of an Australian professional services firm. Based on a factor analysis, we identify nine distinct dimensions of ESN user behavior: Social dispersion, engagement, focus, information sharing, discussing, information seeking, response time, receiving information, and tagging. With this research we contribute to the literature by transferring concepts and methods of organization science and social media research to an ESN context. Further, our approach forms the basis for the identification of different types of knowledge actors, which might ultimately help to improve organizational knowledge transparency.},

Enterprise Social Networks (ESN) have emerged as important tools for informal employee interactions, such as for problem-solving and information sharing. While the analysis of ESN back end data might provide insights into the informal fabric of organizations, and in particular employees' roles in such networks, there is a lack of systematic approaches for carrying out ESN analytics, such as for user role identification. Following a design science research process, a process-based method to identify user roles from ESN data was developed and evaluated. The method's efficacy is demonstrated through an in-depth application in a case study of Australian professional services firm Deloitte. In doing so the paper shows how ESN data can be utilized to derive metrics that characterize participation behavior, message content, and structural network positions of ESN users.},

abstract = {Three-way concept analysis (3WCA), a combination of three-way decision and formal concept analysis, is widely used in the field of knowledge discovery. Generally, constructing three-way concept lattices requires the original formal context and its complement context simultaneously. Additionally, the existing three-way concept lattice construction algorithms focus on the static formal context, and cannot cope with the dynamic formal context that is an essential representation in social networks. Toward this end, this paper pioneers a novel problem and method for the incremental construction of three-way concept lattice for knowledge discovery in social networks. Aiming to facilitate the construction efficiency, this paper firstly investigates the three-way concept lattice construction for attribute-incremental/object-incremental formal contexts, respectively. Then, the dynamic formal context of a social network can be viewed as a special formal context with both attribute-increment and object-increment. Further, we develop the AE/OE concept lattice incremental construction algorithms, called SNS-AE and SNS-OE. Extensive experiments are conducted on various formal contexts to evaluate the effectiveness of our incremental algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed incremental algorithms can significantly decrease the construction time of three-way concept lattice compared to the non-incremental algorithm.},

abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to present a conceptual framework of four knowledge co-creation processes in enterprise social media (ESM). From an interactionist perspective, the paper proposes a model on the role of ESM and enterprise social networks (ESNs) in facilitating knowledge co-creation processes. Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual paper revisits existing literature on ESM, ESNs and social knowledge management to propose, hypothetically, the relationship between ESM, ESN and knowledge co-creation processes. Findings: ESM enhances employee-to-employee interaction, which allows employees to co-create knowledge in a social context. Firstly, ESM affords employees to create ESNs for knowledge co-creation. Secondly, the structure of employee-to-employee interaction in ESNs will influence knowledge co-creation processes. Thirdly, ESNs provide the mechanism through which ESM affordances enable or constrain knowledge co-creation in the organisation. Practical implications: ESM creates a social context that allows employees to share, apply and recreate or reproduce knowledge in the process of knowledge co-creation. The action possibilities of ESM perceived and actualised by employees will enable or constrain knowledge co-creation. Such influences are fuelled by the structural properties of employee relationships on ESM. Originality/value: The paper elucidates the concept of knowledge co-creation based on a representation of user activities in ESM. This paper suggests that knowledge co-creation is a salient outcome of both individual-to-individual interactions on ESM and individual-to-ESM interactions enabled by ESM affordances.},

We focus on this KM tool because it provides employees with an opportunity to strategically reach out to different groups of people within their CoP, and engage in information exchange and communication. Using a content analysis method, we investigate two intermediate information mechanisms (information richness and informal communication) that social media KMDGs are theorized to generate, and quantify their effects on labor productivity and return on assets.

abstract = {Knowledge is key to sustainable competitive advantage, but different kinds of knowledge affect competitive advantage differently, and they exhibit qualitatively different dynamic properties and behaviors. This places particular importance on understanding the dynamics of knowledge as it flows, and organization managers seek to visualize and measure such flows for efficacy and efficiency alike. Unfortunately, knowledge is inherently intangible, invisible and resistant to quantification, particularly when in dynamic motion. Moreover, managing key organization knowledge is left often to haphazard, trial and error processes, rendering pursuits of sustainable competitive advantage daunting at best and infeasible in many cases. Even when guided by well-accepted models in extant theory, managers may not be selecting the best knowledge flow processes for their purposes. The research described in this article builds upon Knowledge Flow Theory and application to initiate a system for visualizing and measuring dynamic knowledge. We leverage a multidimensional model to delineate and analyze a diversity of knowledge as it flows through the organization, and we draw analogically to develop a system of dynamic knowledge equations that enable measurement. We then illustrate its practical use and utility through a representative organization example, which we supplement with decision guidance pertaining to some fundamental knowledge flow tradeoffs facing decision makers. This article closes with a summary of key results and implications, which give us cause to rethink some concepts, assumptions and implications in the literature.},

abstract = {Nowadays, enterprise social media practitioners and researchers are keen to know how the enterprise usage of social media can be converted into the improved organizational performance. Meanwhile, organizational learning has long been considered as one of the measures of organizational performance. This article investigated the impact of enterprise social networking systems (ESNS) usage on knowledge management processes and organizational learning; in particular, we examined the mediating role of knowledge creation and knowledge sharing. Four theories from sociology and strategic management were used to build the hypotheses in the research model. An online survey was conducted to empirically test the model. Our study results showed that ESNS usage directly and indirectly influences organizational learning; and that knowledge management processes (knowledge creation and sharing) mediate the path between the two. This study contributes to the existing literature on enterprise social media for three reasons. First, it is among the first to connect the three independent concepts (social media, knowledge management, and organizational learning) and explore their relationships in one theoretical framework. Second, this work also specifically examines the influence of ESNS (Yammer in this case) on organizational processes and outcomes. Third, this is a pioneering study that employs multiple theories to address the research questions under the organizational social media context. Therefore, the research gives implications for both practitioners and scholars who are interested in understanding the effectiveness of ESNS usage in the modern organizations today.},

But research on dynamic capabilities has advanced considerably since its early years, in which most contributions to this literature were purely conceptual. A plethora of empirical studies as well as further theoretical elaborations have shed substantial light on a variety of specific, measurable factors connected to dynamic capabilities. Our article starts out by analyzing these studies to develop a meta-framework that specifies antecedents, dimensions, mechanisms, moderators, and outcomes of dynamic capabilities identified in the literature to date. This framework provides a comprehensive and systematic synthesis of the dynamic capabilities perspective that reflects the richness of the research while at the same time unifying it into a cohesive, overarching model. Such an analysis has not yet been undertaken; no comprehensive framework with this level of detail has previously been presented for dynamic capabilities. Our analysis shows where research has made the most progress and where gaps and unresolved tensions remain. Based on this analysis, we propose a forward-looking research agenda that outlines directions for future research.},

abstract = {Enterprise collaboration systems (ECS) have become the core of the digital workplace in many organizations. More and more companies have introduced this new business software for supporting computer-mediated collaboration among employees. The emergence of ECS in the technical and strategical landscape of companies leads to new challenges in business intelligence and reporting. In contrast to traditional business software such as ERP systems, there are no established methods for decision-making in ECS projects. The collaboration professionals responsible for managing the ECS require insights into the use of an ECS to understand how employees use these systems. By developing the Social Collaboration Analytics Framework, this work provides a framework for establishing the analysis of collaboration activities in the digital workplace (social collaboration analytics) as part of organizations' business intelligence. The Social Collaboration Analytics Framework consists of distinct phases and guides the analysis of ECS data. It includes working steps, recommendations, and guiding questions developed based on the findings from longitudinal research in a university-industry collaboration context and a comparison of established data mining process models.},

abstract = {Nowadays, online social networks, such as Facebook,1 Twitter2 and Weibo,3 have been adopted by billions of people as the main platforms for daily interaction and socialisation. People disseminate information, express personal opinions, network with others who share the same interest, make businesses and even political campaigns on online social networks. With the recent development on mobile technology, online social networks can be accessed anytime, anywhere. Using online social networks has appeared to be not only a way of communication but also a lifestyle. Consequently, Web social media has attracted much interest from the research community, aiming at gaining a better understanding of not only individual users' but also their collective behaviours, resulting in many theoretical and methodological advancements such as online social network analysis (e.g., [2]), public opinions (e.g., [3]), and community's health and wellbeing on social networks (e.g., [1]). The opportunity has become more apparent and significant, along with the large volume of online social media data becoming},

abstract = {A deeper understanding of collaboration among various stakeholders is imperative towards the success of the Building Information Modelling (BIM) enabled project delivery. A systematic research framework is proposed to properly analyze dynamic changes in stakeholders and their relationships by deploying social network analysis (SNA), assisting in stakeholder management. First, the work breakdown structure (WBS) is performed to organize a BIM project (i.e., rail project) into 4 levels: project name, stage, process, and activity. Second, different stakeholders are clarified based on the activity level over the whole project using interviews and surveys. Third, a project-level social network containing both the project ontology and stakeholders is established, from which cooperation information is then precisely extracted and stakeholder-level social networks with only stakeholders being nodes are created. Finally, SNA is carried out at both network- and node- levels. The results show that: (i) It is feasible to mine the collaboration information between different stakeholders through a project-level social network, (ii) The most active and central actor in each stage is continually changing, and the degree centrality and betweenness centrality are polarized between the stakeholders, (iii) There is a trend for a central stakeholder to be active and a broker at the same time, such as architect (#3), BIM coordinator (#4), BIM modeler (#6), civil & structural engineer (#9), and mechanical & electrical engineer (#18), and (iv) BIM coordinator (#4) should be given more attention, especially from the tender stage on. The research can contribute to both theoretical and practical development: (a) A new novel approach that could make the dynamic collaboration characteristics explicit was proposed with SNA, (b) A good knowledge of the dynamic collaboration attributes among different stakeholders in BIM-based rail projects could encourage a better project outcome.},

abstract = {Over the last years, Enterprise Social Networks (ESN) have gained increasing attention both in academia and practice, resulting in a large number of publications dealing with ESN. Among them is a large number of case studies describing the benefits of ESN in each individual case. Based on the different research objects they focus, various benefits are described. However, an overview of the bene-fits achieved by using ESN is missing and will, thus, be elaborated in this article (research question 1). Further, we cluster the identified benefits to more generic categories and finally classify them to the capabilities of traditional IT as presented by Davenport and Short (1990) to determine if new capabilities of IT arise using ESN (research question 2). To address our research questions, we perform a qualitative content analysis on 37 ESN case studies. As a result, we identify 99 individual benefits, classify them to the capabilities of traditional IT, and define a new IT capability named Social Capital. Our results can, e.g., be used to align and expand current ESN success measurement approaches.},

abstract = {Enterprise Social Networks (ESNs) have been receiving increasingly more attention in academia and practice over the past years. ESNs are implemented to improve collaboration among employees and to foster knowledge management by capturing tacit knowledge, among other reasons. However, ESNs do not always fulfill the companies' expectations and consequently companies question their investment. Due to the growing popularity of ESNs in practice and the still unanswered questions of how to ultimately achieve ESN success, a growing number of researchers have started to analyze the ESN phenomenon, leading to a steadily growing number of publications in a variety of outlets. However, research groups are not in accordance yet on what terminology to use for the given phenomenon. This shows that the young research field of ESNs is still in development. To support future research and practice, we perform a literature review to answer three research questions: first, we analyze which terms for the phenomenon of ESNs were used and which term tends to be accepted by the community recently. Second, we analyze ESN publications regarding the addressed topics to provide a state-of-the-art in regard to ESN research. We elaborate a framework using the dimensions ESN implementation status and focus of investigation to structure the publications and to provide a comprehensive overview of the research topics. Third, we identify areas of future research on the basis of the current publications and trending topics.},

@article{Wu2021,
abstract = {In recent years, with the ability to facilitate knowledge sharing, information exchange, and work collaboration, enterprise social media (ESM) has been widely embraced by business leaders to improve job performance. However, with the deepening of empirical research and practice, ESM usage has also been found to yield various negative outcomes, such as information overload, privacy invasion, turnover intention, and work-life conflict. Ultimately, these negative outcomes will be reflected in a decline in job performance. Given this inconsistent result, this study presents a meta-analysis of the relations between ESM usage and job performance as described in previous empirical literature. The results indicate that there is a significant positive correlation between ESM usage and job performance, subject to several moderators. Specifically, different types of job performance have a moderating effect on the relations between ESM usage and job performance, and the effect of innovation performance and agility performance is greater than that of in-role performance. Samples with a high proportion of females showed stronger effects of ESM usage on job performance, whereas samples with a high proportion of managers showed stronger effects. Moreover, samples from developed countries showed higher effects of ESM usage on job performance than those from developing countries. These findings hold several implications for related theoretical research and business management practices.},
